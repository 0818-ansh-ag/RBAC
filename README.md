# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface**

## **Project Summary**

This project involves creating a frontend interface for a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system. It provides an intuitive admin dashboard for managing users, assigning roles, and configuring permissions. The focus is on building a secure, functional, and user-friendly UI to handle administrative tasks efficiently.

The application is developed using **React** for the frontend and styled with **Bootstrap** to ensure a modern, responsive design. It simulates key RBAC functionalities like user and role CRUD operations, dynamic permission management, and role-based access, mimicking a real-world scenario.

---

## **Main Features**

### **User Management**

- Display a list of users with the ability to create, update, and remove entries.
- Assign roles to users and manage their activation status (Active or Inactive).

### **Role Management**

- Create and update roles, each with specific permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete.
- Provide flexibility to customize permissions for each role.

### **Permission Management**

- A clear and simple interface for assigning and updating permissions associated with roles.
- Toggle and modify role permissions dynamically.

### **Simulated API Functionality**

- Mock API endpoints to demonstrate CRUD operations for users, roles, and permissions.
- Server-like responses for testing application functionality in a development environment.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Framework for responsive styling and layouts.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development environment.
- **Mock APIs**: Used to simulate backend functionality for CRUD operations.

## **Capabilities**

### **Manage Users**

- Admins can create new users, update their details, and remove them as needed.
- Assign specific roles to users and control their activation status.

### **Manage Roles**

- Add new roles and associate them with specific permissions.
- Modify existing roles by adding or removing permissions.

### **Dynamic Permission Assignment**

- Flexible interface to manage role permissions dynamically using toggles or selectors.
- Ensures real-time updates to roles and associated user access.

### **Responsive Design**

- Fully optimized for devices of all sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### **Error Handling and Security**

- Implements basic input validation to prevent invalid entries.
- Handles errors from simulated API calls gracefully to enhance user experience.

### **Extras**

- Features for sorting, filtering, and searching users and roles to improve usability.
- Highly flexible permissions structure for accommodating a variety of access requirements.

## **How It Works**

1. **User Management**

   - Admins can view all users, create new ones, edit details, or delete them.
   - Assign one or more roles to a user and toggle their activation status.

2. **Role Management**

   - Create roles and associate them with specific permissions.
   - Manage the permissions for each role to align with organizational needs.

3. **Permission Assignment**
   - Dynamically assign or modify permissions for roles through an interactive UI.

---

## **Assessment Criteria**

- **Design and Innovation**: The UI is modern, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.
- **Feature Implementation**: All key functionalities for managing users, roles, and permissions are operational.
- **Responsiveness**: The interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
- **Ease of Use**: The UI ensures clarity, making administrative tasks intuitive and efficient.
- **Code Quality**: The code is modular, clean, and adheres to React best practices.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- Connect to a real backend API for live data management.
- Introduce advanced features such as role inheritance, activity logging, and audit trails.
- Strengthen security with authentication and role-based route access control.
